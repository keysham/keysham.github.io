   		<td>[Piece 1:  My social justice topic is animal abuse i chose it because no one really pays attention to the poor animals that het abandon and mistreated. Itn is important to me because i love animals i have this soft spot.i chose a few pictures that showed what i wanted and it look great. I used layer mask for the majority of my project.

   		<td>[Piece 2:In the project that we did that we to chose a picture of ourselves and change them and give it definition in color and change in look. The tools that we used on app i started by using the crop tool to make it a box then used the color system and put a color that would complement the green with also a blue green witch pared well even tho they we similar colors i struggled a little but it was a fun part of the project overall 
 
   		<td>[Piece 3: I used a flower shape witch was difficult to work with and turning  it into a mandala i used blue and red and they did not part at first but i made it work some how . i used we reversed and moved arou the shapes to turn it into a mandala and basically repeated the same steps intil it was full and look good.
